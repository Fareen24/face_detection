This face detection app  allows users to upload an image or use their webcam for real-time face detection. Hereâ€™s a quick summary of its main features:

1. **Face Detection on Image Upload**: Users can upload an image, apply enhancements (grayscale, brightness, contrast), and adjust detection parameters (`scaleFactor`, `minNeighbors`, and rectangle color) to improve detection.
   
   - **Face Detection Execution**: A button initiates face detection on the uploaded image.

2. **Face Detection via Webcam**: Users can enable their webcam, which runs real-time face detection.
   - **Stop Webcam Button**: Allows users to stop the video feed at any time.
   - **Image Saving Option**: Users can choose to save the frame after detection.

3. **Detection Parameter Sidebar**: Users have additional controls for color and face detection parameters, such as `scaleFactor` and `minNeighbors`.
